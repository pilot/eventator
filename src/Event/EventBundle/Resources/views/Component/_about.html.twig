                        <p>Clean code is like
                            teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone
                            thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it... It is
                            essential that the codes we write should be able to be understood by all. This talk
                            will give you introduction to the principles how to write clean code that is
                            maintainable and extensible on long terms.</p>
